  <p>
    I am a developer, musician, and teacher with a passion for helping others.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is my attempt at an actual blog where I write stuff. It focuses mostly
    on tech and developer things, but it will veer into my other interests too.
    For music stuff, check out my
    <a href="https://farshadzadeh.com">other website</a>.
  </p>

  <p>My technical skills include:</p>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>
</BaseLayout>
