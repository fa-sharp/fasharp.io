        I'm Farshad üëãüèº! I'm a musician and teacher who's been coding for two
        years. I have a passion for building useful, joyful, accessible apps and
        helping others do the same.

    This is a little website and blog where I write about my coding journey,
    things I'm working on, showcase projects, and do other nerdy things. I focus
    mostly on tech and developer stuff, but I may veer into my other interests
    too. If you're looking for music and/or are not sure what all this is about,
    check out my
    <a href="https://farshadzadeh.com">other website</a>.
