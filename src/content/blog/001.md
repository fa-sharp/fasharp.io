Hello there, fancy seeing you here ðŸ˜‰! For my first post, I thought I'd give a brief overview of the stack/tech I'm using to build my new developer website. I settled on using [Astro](https://astro.build), an awesome framework that's a _relative_ newcomer to the JavaScript framework land (but what JS framework isn't a newcomer these days??)

The 'finalists' were Astro and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I loved a lot of things about Hugo - especially just how _quickly_ you can get up and running with a fully fledged website. But I decided I really wanted to stay within the JS ecosystem - fractured and chaotic as it is...

A few things I like about Astro: Astro comes with scoped CSS out of the box, which makes styling quite simple. It easily supports importing React/Svelte/Vue/etc. components through its [islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/), which may come in handy when I want to 'show off' something I'm working on. And Astro recently released their v3.0, which comes with neat features like image optimization and native support for the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) (which you can see in action on this site ðŸ˜Ž). At the same time, Astro manages to stay 'out of the way' to build your site the way you want.
