Choosing a JavaScript framework to learn or use in your project, when you're just getting started out with coding on the web, can be pretty overwhelming. React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Ember, Lit, Solid... and that's just _some_ of the frontend frameworks - don't even get me started on the full-stack and backend JS frameworks ðŸ¤¯. Here are some pointers and tips I've learned along the way to sort through this mess:

## Start with the fundamentals of the web
In other words - HTML, CSS, and plain/"vanilla" JavaScript. Having a fundamental understanding of these three languages is absolutely vital when you're learning a new framework, as you want to have some idea of what's going on "under the hood." Resources like [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) are great for getting up to speed on these.

## Choose one framework to learn, and stick with it
It turns out that, contrary to what you might hear from each framework's marketing or their "fanboys" on social media, there are actually _so many_ similarities between the various frameworks - especially when it comes to high-level concepts and ideas: things like reactivity, state management, rendering, lifecycles, side effects, data fetching and caching, etc. etc. Yes, each framework has its own take on _how_ to do those things, but those underlying concepts are always there.

So, I think it behooves you to stick with one framework and really go in depth with it. You'll learn so many things that you can take with you to other frameworks if needed. And I don't think it matters that much which one you choose - that being said, the _one_ consideration you might want to keep in mind is which framework is most in demand when looking for a job. Currently, that would be React, but this could change at any time, so take a look at job listings if this is an important consideration for you!

## Read the docs, build things, and avoid tutorials
Once you've chosen a framework to learn, If the framework itself has
